# Dollar Computers

**Assignment 5 | COMP123 Programming II**
**Centennial College**

This is the git repository for Dollar Computers. This app was created as an 
assignment for COMP123 Programming II at Centennial College.

# Overview

Upon starting the application, the application splash screen will show for a few 
seconds.

The splashscreen image, if memory serves correctly, was taken from Pixabay, and
edited in Adobe Photoshop CS6.

Once the splashscreen disappears, the main menu UI will appear. From here, the 
user will be able to select the following options:

 * Start New Order
 * Load Saved Order
 * Exit 

If the user has started a previous order and saved it, they can reload the order
through the **Load Saved Order** button. Orders are saved as *.txt* files.

The logo was created through Adobe Photoshop CS6.

Once a new order is started, the user can view a list of computers they can 
choose from. The *Selected Computer* field will change depending on the currently 
highlighted computer in the list box.

# Requirements


I was very proud of how my implementation of Assignment 5 Dollar Computers had 
turned out. It is one of the assignments from COMP123 at Centennial College that 
I've decided to showcase for my personal website. With that said, it is possible 
that the instructions for this assignment are unchanged, or have been slightly 
modified since I took the course. I am _not responsible_ for any plagiarism that 
takes place in the event that my code is copied and submitted for evaluation.
