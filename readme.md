I was very proud of how my implementation of Assignment 5 Dollar Computers had 
turned out. It is one of the assignments from COMP123 at Centennial College that 
I've decided to showcase for my personal website. With that said, it is possible 
that the instructions for this assignment are unchanged, or have been slightly 
modified since I took the course. I am _not responsible_ for any plagiarism that 
takes place in the event that my code is copied and submitted for evaluation.
